        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Donald Williams, a software developer. 
            My career path started to unfold at a young age while, not uncommonly, playing videogames.
            I would talk with my brother about grandiose ideas that would make the game so much better.
            Eventually, I learned that these games and every other application we used were programmed.
            Being one who loves to create things and dig into the gory details of the most mundane of processes,
            I quickly fell in love. Enough about my story. Check out some of my work on the <href>Projects</href> page.</p>
